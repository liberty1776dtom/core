Feature: delete users
  As an admin
  I want to delete users
  So that I can remove users

  Background:
    Given these users have been created but not initialized:
      | username | password  | displayname | email        |
      | user1    | %regular% | User One    | u1@oc.com.np |
      | user2    | %regular% | User Two    | u2@oc.com.np |
    And the administrator has logged in using the webUI
    And the administrator has browsed to the users page

  Scenario: use the webUI to delete a simple user
    When the administrator deletes user "user1" using the webUI and confirms the deletion using the webUI
    And the deleted user "user1" tries to login using the password "%regular%" using the webUI
    Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "%productname%"
    When the user has browsed to the login page
    And user "user2" logs in using the webUI
    Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Files - %productname%"

  Scenario: use the webUI to cancel deletion of user
    When the administrator deletes user "user1" using the webUI and cancels the deletion using the webUI
    Then user "user1" should exist
